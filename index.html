        <p>Rotom (ロトム) is a dual Electric-/Ghost-type Pokemon introduced in the 4th generation of pokemon.</p>

        <p>While it is not known to evolve, it does have multiple other forms it can take by controlling appliances, 5 of which change Rotom's type.</p>

        <p>
          Rotom is a small, orange Pokémon that has a body of plasma. 
          It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long 
          pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. 
          There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms 
          lightning bolt-shaped appendages. It has teeth, and its unique, 
          blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, 
          Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked 
          in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base 
          form is possessing a light bulb. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Rotom has the ability to enter and control appliances. Rotom 
          typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the 
          household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people,
          as seen in the anime. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to 
          inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom 
          Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, Rotom Bike, and Drone Rotom are some 
          examples. The creation of Rotom Pokédex in particular was inspired 
          by Mow Rotom. Some of these particular forms allow Rotom to speak 
          human languages. These forms show that Rotom is also highly intelligent. 
          As also shown in the anime, Rotom has the ability to time travel. 
          Rotom tends to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues 
          on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors.

          Honestly I just wanted some more stuff on 
          here so I kinda stole this from the fan wiki.

      <section>
        <h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

        <p>Here are Rotom's base stats.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>HP</th>
              <th>Attack</th>
              <th>Defense</th>
              <th>Special Attack</th>
              <th>Special Defense</th>
              <th>Speed</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>77</td>
              <td>95</td>
              <td>77</td>
              <td>91</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>When Rotom changes it's form, it's stats also change, as follows:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>HP</th>
              <th>Attack</th>
              <th>Defense</th>
              <th>Special Attack</th>
              <th>Special Defense</th>
              <th>Speed</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>65</td>
              <td>107</td>
              <td>105</td>
              <td>107</td>
              <td>86</td>
             </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>

        <p>As stated previously, Rotom can take on many forms 
        depending on the appliance it's controlling. 5 of these
        forms change Rotom's stats and typing. The rest are just
        cosmetic. Well he basically has an unlimited amount of forms
        but since this is a game they kinda have a limit to what
        they can program. Am I getting off track?

            I know they're not real, and also fantasy 
            creatures, but it was always kinda weird 
            to me that the Rotom Phone is just a phone
            with a thing living in it. That you own.
            Does the Rotom want to be a phone?
